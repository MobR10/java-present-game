This game has been created following the tutorials of RyiSnow from the Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow
It is an old game I designed from scratch with the help of Mr. RyiSnow. Created my own pixel art designs for the tiles and custom sounds, with the exception of the birds sound I found online and the background music, which is from Sword Art Online.
The main character's design is also made by me, but inspired by Asuna from SAO too.
The game as intended as a birthday gift for my girlfriend at the time. 
Development started somewhere at the beginning of March 2022 and finished it on the 18th of April 2022. Uploaded the code on GitHub on 26.04.2025. 

CONTROLS:
Inside the menu - W (up), S (down) , ENTER (select)
MOVE - WASD
JUMP - Spacebar
Attack - Hover the cursor on the right side of the left side and LEFT CLICK for directional melee attack
Bow attack - Same for the melee attack, but RIGHT CLICK
Jump attack - While mid-air, LEFT CLICK or RIGHT CLICK for melee / bow attack
C - open/close Inventory
E - interact with POP-UPS / NPCs (hold move button to move towards them and then press E to interact)


ESC to pause the game / (exit / continue) dialogues (yes, you have to keep interacting and exiting the dialogue of an NPC to read the actual dialogue :DD)
F11 to fullscreen
R to reload entities (kill more to level up more)
T shows coordinates

#Note when uploading: there is an error I have to fix with the code, but the .jar is working just fine.
